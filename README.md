## 🎯 The Idea
*Why We Wonder* is a **non-competitive game** designed to spark **meaningful dialogue**. Inspired by history's greatest thinkers, players explore timeless questions together by linking ideas into a shared chain of thought.

---

## 🃏 What’s in the Deck
Each card shows:
- **Philosopher** – the thinker behind the idea.
- **Key Idea** – a core concept they are known for.
- **Category** – the “realm” of thought:
  - 🌀 **Self & Identity** – Who are we inside? What shapes our experience?
  - 🧠 **Knowledge & Truth** – How do we understand the world and make choices?
  - 🫀 **Values & Culture** – What do we owe one another? How do we live together?
  - 🌍 **Systems & Society** – How do institutions, power, and structures shape life?
- **Question** – reframed in everyday language, ready to spark discussion.

---

## 🎲 Setup
1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Place two random cards face-up in the center — these are the **Starting** and **Destination** questions.
3. Deal **7 cards** to each player.

---

## 🔄 How to Play
1. On your turn, play one card from your hand to **connect it** to any card already in play.
   - Your “link” may reference the **question**, the **category**, or the **philosopher’s idea**.
   - Other players can **challenge unclear links** — if the group agrees, the card is not played.
2. Play continues clockwise, building **paths of connected ideas**.
   - Threads may branch, loop, or stall — not all paths will succeed.
3. The **goal** is to eventually link the chain of cards back to the **Destination** card.

---

## 🏁 Ending the Game
- The game ends when there is a **clear path** from the Start to the Destination card.
- The player who places the final card must **summarize the full journey** of ideas aloud — weaving the story of how the group got from Start to End.

## ✨ Tips for Play
- Be generous: every idea is a gift to the group.
- Be clear: explain your links so others can follow.
- Be curious: ask questions, explore, and have fun!
