This project blends **AI assistance, open crowd sourced knowledge (from Wikipedia), and playful design** to create a unique learning tool for exploring philosophy together. (Read the [How the Game Was Generated](#how-the-game-was-generated) section below for more info on how this was created)

## 🃏 What’s in the Deck
Each card shows:
- **Philosopher** – the thinker behind the idea.
- **Key Idea** – a core concept they are known for.
- **Category** – the “realm” of thought:
  - 🌀 **Self & Identity** – Who are we inside? What shapes our experience?
  - 🧠 **Knowledge & Truth** – How do we understand the world and make choices?
  - 🫀 **Values & Culture** – What do we owe one another? How do we live together?
  - 🌍 **Systems & Society** – How do institutions, power, and structures shape life?
- **Question** – reframed in everyday language, ready to spark discussion.

---

## 🎲 Setup
1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Place two random cards face-up in the center — these are the **Starting** and **Destination** questions.
3. Deal **7 cards** to each player.

---

## 🔄 How to Play
1. On your turn, play one card from your hand to **connect it** to any card already in play.
   - Your “link” may reference the **question**, the **category**, or the **philosopher’s idea**.
   - Other players can **challenge unclear links** — if the group agrees, the card is not played and the player draws a new card and end their turn without playing a card
2. Play continues clockwise, building **paths of connected ideas**.
   - Threads may branch, loop, or stall — not all paths will succeed.
3. The **goal** is to eventually link the chain of cards back to the **Destination** card.

---

## 🏁 Ending the Game
- The game ends when there is a **clear path** from the Start to the Destination card.
- The player who places the final card must **summarize the full journey** of ideas aloud — weaving the story of how the group got from Start to End.

---

## ✨ Tips for Play
- Be generous: every idea is a gift to the group.  
- Be clear: explain your links so others can follow.  
- Be curious: ask questions, explore, and have fun!
